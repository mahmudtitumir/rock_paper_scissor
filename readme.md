# Rock, Paper, Scissors game using C.

Hi there, 
During my high school years, I was a big fan of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game and played it often with my friends. It occurred to me that it would be great to have a computer version of the game, so I took it upon myself to create one. Now, even when I'm on my own, I can enjoy playing this game whenever I want. You can try this.
